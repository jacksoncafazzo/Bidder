Navbar
  - Each HTML page should have the same NavBar. Make sure links all have the correct href.

  - can't get padding off navbar button

Styles
  - organize global styles.css so it is clear what page the styles belong to
  - try to have elements styled the same way on different pages (ex: same result for clicking "I'm interested" button on Jobber Board and on Post A Bid page)
  - make carousel/header images the same height, maybe make sure the text on it is shadowed if necessary

Map
  - hardcode some location tags/info windows on the Post a Bid page and also the Home Page (Possible???)
  - get info windows appending user input (Jackson)


Bids
  - option to remove bids?


Post A Bid page
  - Get I'm Interested buttons to pop up the same modal that pops up on jobber board page

Jobber Pages
  - margin under navbar/above photo that doesn't exist on other pages
  - buttons should lead to the correct pages (link to jobber board)

About Page
  - Filler text replace with actual about section, content clean up

Footers
  - add global footer to each page -- fix styling on about page footer
