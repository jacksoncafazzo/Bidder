Navbar
  - Each HTML page should have the same NavBar. Make sure links all have the correct href.

  - can't get padding off navbar button

Styles
  - organize global styles.css so it is clear what page the styles belong to
  - try to have elements styled the same way on different pages
  - make carousel/header images the same height, maybe make sure the text on it is shadowed if necessary

Map
  - hardcode some location tags/info windows on the Post a Bid page and also the Home Page (Possible???)
  - get info windows appending user input (Jackson)


Bids
  - option to remove bids after posting it??? -- pop up a modal with a password to do it? (hardcode password 'delete' ?)



Jobber Pages
  - margin under navbar/above photo that doesn't exist on other pages
  - buttons should lead to the correct pages (link to jobber board)
  - on jobber board, add "Not a jobber yet? Sign up here" link
  - fix footers
  - fix photo shadow

About Page
  - Filler text replace with actual about section, content clean up
